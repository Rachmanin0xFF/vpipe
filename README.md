I'm ust throwing the source code up here as I work on it; this is not yet fit for distribution.

This is a little "DIY V-Tubing" experiment I've been working on. It runs alongside a modified version of [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace) (not included here). I correct facial distortions present in OSF with simple multivariable quadratic regression, and I use [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) to display the tracking points.

I'm planning on adding a rigid body sim and the ability to import custom models, etc.
